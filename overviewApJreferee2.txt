Dear Editor,

We are submitting a revised version of the paper "LSST: from Science Drivers to Reference Design
and Anticipated Data Products by Ivezic et al.". We are thankful to the referee for reading our
revised paper. We have implemented the suggested change to our asteroid photometry discussion.
We hope that the revised version is now suitable for publication.

         For the authors,
           Zeljko Ivezic

In response to this comment we have made the following changes:

Page 7, the following text from the right column:

"The photometry should be better than 1–2% to measure asteroids’ colors and thus
determine their types. The different filters should be observed over a short time
span to reduce apparent variations in color due to changes in observing geometry,
but should be repeated over many lunations in order to determine phase curves and
allow shape modeling.”

has been modified to (emphasis added):

"The *photometric calibration* should be better than 1–2% to measure asteroids’ colors
and thus determine their types. *If possible,* the different filters should be observed
over a short time span to reduce apparent variations in color due to changes in observing
geometry, but should be repeated over many lunations in order to determine phase curves
and allow shape modeling.”

Figure 25 caption, the following text:

"LSST color measurements of asteroids will be more than twice as accurate and will
increase the number of objects by roughly two orders of magnitude.”

has been modified to (emphasis added):

"LSST color measurements of asteroids will be *at least as accurate as SDSS measurements
shown here* and will increase the number of objects by roughly two orders of magnitude.”
