\section{  INTRODUCTION}
 
Major advances in our understanding of the Universe have historically arisen
from dramatic improvements in our ability to ``see''. We have developed
progressively larger telescopes over the past century, allowing us 
to peer further into space, and further back in time. With the development of 
advanced instrumentation -- imaging, spectroscopic, and polarimetric -- we 
have been able to parse radiation detected from distant sources over the 
full electromagnetic spectrum in increasingly subtle ways. 
These data have provided the detailed information needed to construct physical 
models of planets, stars, galaxies, quasars, and larger structures. 

Until recently, most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples 
of cosmic sources or individual objects. This is because our largest telescope 
facilities typically had rather small fields of view, and those with large
fields of view could not detect very faint sources. With all of our existing 
telescope facilities, we have still surveyed only a small fraction of the 
observable Universe (except when considering the most luminous quasars). 

Over the past two decades, however, advances in technology have made it possible to 
move beyond the traditional observational paradigm and to undertake large-scale 
sky surveys. As vividly demonstrated by surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey (SDSS; York et al.~2000), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;
Skrutskie et al.~2006), and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX; Martin et
al.~2006), to name but a few, sensitive and accurate 
multi-color surveys over a large fraction of the sky enable an extremely broad range of 
new scientific investigations. These projects, based on a synergy of advances in 
telescope construction, detectors, and above all, information technology, 
have dramatically impacted nearly all fields of astronomy 
-- and many areas of fundamental physics. In addition, the world-wide attention 
received by Sky in Google Earth\footnote{http://earth.google.com/sky/}
(Scranton et al.~2007)  and the hundreds of thousands of volunteers
classifying galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al.~2011)
and its extensions 
demonstrate that the impact of sky surveys extends
far beyond fundamental science progress and reaches all of society.

Motivated by the evident scientific progress enabled by large sky surveys,
three nationally-endorsed reports by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences\footnote{
  Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium, NAS 2001; 
  Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century, NAS 2003; 
  New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated Exploration Strategy, NAS 2003.   
}
concluded that a dedicated ground-based wide-field imaging telescope with an effective aperture 
of 6--8 meters is a high priority for planetary science, astronomy, and physics 
over the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) described here is 
such a system. The LSST will be a large, wide-field ground-based telescope 
designed to obtain multi-band images over a substantial fraction of the sky
every few nights. The survey will yield contiguous overlapping imaging of over
half the sky in six optical bands, with each sky location visited close to 1000 times over 
10 years. The recent 2010 report ``New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics''
by the Committee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and 
Astrophysics\footnote{http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record\_id=12951}
ranked LSST as its top priority for large ground-based projects, and in May 2014 the National 
Science Board approved the project for construction. 

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overall summary of the main LSST
science drivers and how they led to the current system design parameters 
(\S~\ref{Sec:refdesign}), to describe anticipated data products (\S~\ref{Sec:dataprod}), 
and to provide a few examples of the science programs that LSST will enable 
(\S~\ref{Sec:science}). The community involvement is discussed in \S~\ref{Sec:community}, 
and broad educational and societal impacts in \S~\ref{Sec:impact}. Concluding 
remarks are presented in \S~\ref{Sec:conclusions}. This publication will be maintained 
at the arXiv.org site\footnote{http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366}, and will also
be available from the LSST website (www.lsst.org). The latest arXiv version of this paper 
should be consulted and referenced for the most up-to-date information about the 
LSST system.
