\section{  EXAMPLES OF LSST SCIENCE PROJECTS                    }
\label{Sec:science}

The design and optimization of the LSST system leverages its unique capability 
to scan a large sky area to a faint flux limit in a short amount of time. 
The main product of the LSST system will be a multi-color $ugrizy$ image of about 
half the sky to unprecedented depth ($r\sim27.5$). For a comparison, the best 
analogous contemporary dataset is that of SDSS, which provides $ugriz$ images
of about a quarter of the sky to $r\sim22.5$, with twice as large seeing
(see Figs.~\ref{Fig:panels1} and \ref{Fig:panels2}). A major advantage of LSST 
is the fact that this deep sky map will be produced by taking hundreds of
shorter exposures (see Table 1). Each sky position within the main survey area 
will be observed about 1000 times, with time scales spanning seven orders of 
magnitude (from 30 sec to 10 years), and produce over {\it a trillion 
photometric measures} of celestial sources.

It is not possible to predict all the science that LSST data will enable.
We now briefly discuss a few projects to give a flavor of anticipated studies,
organized by the four science themes that drive the LSST design 
(although some projects span more than one theme). 
\B{For an in-depth discussion of LSST science cases, we refer the reader to the 
LSST Science Book.}

\subsection{Probing Dark Energy and Dark Matter }

A unique aspect of LSST as a probe of dark energy and dark matter is
the use of multiple cross-checking probes that reach unprecedented
precision (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:DEellipses}). Any given probe constrains
degenerate combinations of cosmological parameters, and each probe is
affected by different systematics, thus the combination of probes
allows systematics to be calibrated out and for degeneracies to be
broken.  Dark energy manifests itself in two ways.  The first is the
relationship between redshift and distance (the Hubble diagram), or
equivalently the expansion rate of the Universe as a function of
cosmic time.  The second is the rate at which matter clusters with
time.  
Structure formation involves a balance between
gravitational attraction of matter over-densities and the rapid
expansion of the background.  Thus, quantifying the rate of growth of
structures from early times until the present provides additional
tests of the energy contents of the Universe and their interactions.

The joint analysis of LSST weak lensing and BAO is
particularly powerful in constraining the dynamical behavior of dark
energy, i.e., how it evolves with cosmic time or redshift (Hu \& Jain
2004; Zhan 2006).  By
simultaneously measuring the growth of large-scale structure, and
luminosity and angular distances as functions of redshift (via weak
lensing, BAO, SN, and cluster counting), LSST data can reveal whether
the recent cosmic acceleration is due to dark energy or modified
gravity (Lue, Scoccimarro \& Starkman 2004; Knox, Song \& Tyson 2006;
Ishak, Upadhye \& Spergel 2006; Jain \& Zhang 2008; Oguri \& Takada
2011; Jain et al.~2013; Weinberg et al.~2013).

Over a broad range of accessible redshifts, the simple linear model
for the dark energy equation of state ($w = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$) is a poor representation of more
general dark energy theories. Barnard et al.~(2008) have shown that in a high-dimensional dark energy model space, 
LSST data could lead to a hundred- to thousand-fold increase in precision over 
precursor experiments about to be undertaken, thereby confirming its status as 
a premier Stage IV experiment in the sense of Albrecht et al.~(2006). 
%Fits of multi-parameter dark energy models to the complementary LSST
%probes of dark energy will constrain alternative models of gravity.

The power and accuracy of LSST dark energy and dark matter probes are
a result of the enormous samples that LSST will have, including 
several billion galaxies and millions of Type Ia
supernovae. At $i < 25.3$ (SNR${}>20$ for point sources), the
photometry of galaxies will be of high enough quality to give
photometric redshifts with an accuracy ($\sigma/(1+z)$) of 1-2\% (only
10\% of the sample will have redshift errors larger than 4\%); the
sample to this limit will include about four billion galaxies.  At a
slightly brighter cut, there will be about 40 galaxies arcmin${-2}$
with shapes measured well enough for weak lensing measurements.  
%The nominal high-SNR galaxy sample defined by $i<25.3$ (SNR$>$20 for point
%sources) will include four billion galaxies (56 arcmin$^{-2}$; the surface density of galaxies 
%used for weak lensing analysis will be about 40 arcmin$^{-2}$) with a mean 
%photometric redshift accuracy of 1-2\% (relative error for $1+z$), and with 
%only 10\% of the sample with redshift errors larger than 4\%. 
The median redshift for 
this sample will be $z\sim$1.2, with the third quartile at $z\sim2$. 
%For a subsample of 2 billion galaxies further constrained by flux limits in the 
%$g$ and $z$ bands, the photometric redshift errors will be about two times 
%smaller. 
It will be possible to further improve photometric redshift calibration
by cross-correlating the photometric sample with redshift surveys of
galaxies and quasars in the same fields (Newman 2008; Matthews \&
Newman 2010; Menard et al.~2013).

oscillations (Eisenstein et al.~2005; Cole et al.~2005; Anderson et al.~2014). LSST will measure the

(Zhan \& Knox 2006).}

\end{figure}


The main LSST observables in the context of dark energy and matter will be

\begin{itemize}
\item Measurements of the two-point auto- and cross-correlation of
  shear across multiple redshift bins (Fig.~\ref{Fig:wlPk}). There will be 
over 50 of these auto and cross power spectra constructed from the
shape catalog with excellent photometric redshifts
%correlation of shear of a galaxy at one redshift bin with another galaxy in 
%a different redshift bin, averaged over all pairs of billions of
%galaxies; 
(Jain \& Taylor 2003).
\item Higher-order shear and galaxy statistics that can improve dark energy 
constraints and provide self-calibration of various systematics (Takada \& Jain 2004; 
Dolney, Jain \& Takada 2006; Huterer et al.~2006). They are also probes of both
primordial non-Gaussianities and those caused by non-linear structure.
\item Similarly, weak lens magnification tomography (Morrison et al.~2012) offers a 
complementary probe of a mix of cosmic geometry and growth of dark matter structure.
\item The galaxy-mass correlation function of billions of galaxies (as a function of their 
photometric redshift) probes the growth of dark matter large-scale structure and is a 
diagnostic of the underlying cosmology (Choi et al.~2012). Combining this with the 
galaxy-velocity power spectrum estimated from spectroscopic observations of millions of galaxies 
could probe General Relativity at high redshift (Reyes et al.~2007).
\item Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy angular correlation functions.
The standard ruler of the sound horizon at decoupling which is imprinted on the mass 
distribution at all redshifts provides a direct way of measuring the angular diameter
distance as a function of redshift (Fig.~\ref{Fig:bao}; Eisenstein, Hu \& Tegmark 1998;
Cooray et al.~2001; Blake \& Glazebrook 2003; Hu \& Haiman 2003; Linder 2003; Seo \& 
Eisenstein 2003). LSST photo-z BAO will achieve percent level precision on the angular 
diameter distance at $\sim$10 redshifts logarithmically spaced between z = 0.4 to 3.6 
with this CMB-calibrated standard ruler. When combined with CMB 
and weak lensing (WL) cosmic shear, this combination of probes yields tight constraints on the 
dynamical behavior of dark energy (Fig.~\ref{Fig:bao2}). In particular, high-redshift BAO data can break 
the degeneracy between curvature and dark energy, and constrain $\Omega_k$ to within 
0.001.
%, which is about ten times better than the most accurate current
%result based on WMAP and SDSS data (Komatsu et al.~2009; Percival et
%al.~2010).  
%I TOOK THIS OUT; THIS CONSTRAINT IS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF PLANCK.
\item Supernovae. The two LSST observing programs are complementary: the main survey will 
obtain light curves in six bands and photometric redshifts of about 300,000 Type
Ia supernovae per year (permitting a search for a ``third parameter'' which,
if not understood, may introduce systematic error in luminosity evolution; 
Wood-Vasey et al.~2007), and the rapid sampling ``mini-survey'' of selected
areas will yield well-sampled light curves of tens of thousands of supernovae
to a limiting redshift beyond one (leading to an independent test of dark energy 
dynamics; Riess et al.~2007). 
\item Unique constraints on anisotropy of cosmological parameters over the sky using
SN, WL and BAO, which will test fundamental cosmological assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy.
For example, WL$+$BAO and SN can separately probe anisotropy of dark energy (Zhan, Knox \& Tyson 2009).
\item The shape of the power spectrum of dark matter fluctuations measured by
the LSST weak lensing maps will constrain the sum of neutrino masses with an accuracy 
of 0.04 eV or better (Cooray 1999; Song \& Knox 2004; Hannestad, Tu \& Wong 2006). 
The current best limit, as derived from a combination of WMAP, the SDSS power spectrum, 
SN, and the Ly$\alpha$ forest, is 0.17 eV (Seljak et al.~2006).
\item Hundreds of millions of galaxy-galaxy lenses will provide the needed statistics to probe dark matter 
halo profiles and substructure (Mandelbaum et al.~2006). The image fluxes in several thousand well-measured
strongly lensed quasars will enable constraints of the dark matter mass function on small scales (Dalal \& Kochanek 2002).
\item The abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift is sensitive to cosmological parameters
(SciBook, Ch.~13). LSST will produce a large catalog of clusters detected through their member galaxy population 
out to and beyond redshift unity.  In addition, LSST will identify optical counterparts and provide deep optical
imaging for clusters detected in other wavebands (e.g., Staniszewski et al.~2009). 
\item The distribution of strongest WL shear peaks with redshift is
  closely related to the galaxy cluster abundance, but has the
  potential to be a more robust and more directly calibratable statistic. This is a simultaneous 
probe of the universal mass function and the growth of structure, and provides a useful 
constraint on dark energy (Wang et al.~2005). LSST will find over 200,000 such 
shear peaks on galaxy cluster scales. 
\item LSST will discover several hundred galaxy clusters that produce multiple-image lenses of background objects.
Cluster mass reconstruction based on the multiple image positions
 can probe the cluster inner mass profile, and can provide a separate test of cosmology, especially 
in cases with strongly lensed background objects at different redshift (Porciani \& Madau 2000; Oguri \& Kawano 2003).
\item Time delays of galaxy-scale lensed quasars will allow one to measure Hubble's constant 
(e.g. Suyu et al.~2010) in hundreds or thousands of systems; sub-percent level precision in 
$H(z)$ should be achievable (Coe \& Moustakas 2009), providing a further independent dark energy probe. 
Time delays for quasars multiply lensed by clusters as a function of redshift are an independent test
of dark energy (Kundi\'{c} et al.~1997). The natural timescale (many months to years) is well matched
to the LSST survey (Oguri \& Marshall 2010). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Taking an Inventory of the Solar System}


The small bodies of the Solar System, such as main-belt asteroids,
the Trojan populations of the giant planets and the Kuiper Belt objects,
offer a unique insight into its early stages because they provide
samples of the original solid materials of the solar nebula. 
Understanding these populations, both physically and in their number 
and size distribution, is a key element in testing various theories of
Solar System formation and evolution. 

The baseline LSST cadence will result in orbital parameters for several
million objects; these will be dominated by main-belt asteroids, with 
light curves and multi-color photometry for a substantial fraction of detected objects. 
This dataset will yield 10 to 100 times more objects than are currently
available with orbits, colors, and variability information. LSST is capable of reaching the Congressional target 
completeness of 90\% for PHAs larger than 140 m (\S~\ref{Sec:NEOc}), and will detect over 30,000 TNOs 
brighter than $r\sim24.5$ using its baseline cadence. LSST will be capable
of detecting objects like Sedna to beyond 100 AU, thus enabling {\it in situ} exploration
far beyond the edge of the Kuiper belt at $\sim$50 AU. Because most of these
objects will be observed several hundred times, accurate orbital elements, 
colors, and variability information will also be available.

\caption{An example of color-based asteroid taxonomy. The figure
shows the distribution of asteroids in the proper semi-major axis vs. $\sin(i)$
plane for 45,000 asteroids with colors measured by SDSS (Parker et al.~2008). 
The color of each dot is representative of the object's color.
Note the strong correlation between asteroid families (objects in distinct regions
of the plane) and colors. There are
at least five different taxonomic types distinguishable with SDSS measurements;
LSST color measurements of asteroids will be more than twice as accurate
and will increase the number of objects by roughly two orders of magnitude.}

depending on the albedo. Specialized deeper observations  
(see \S~\ref{Sec:minisurveys}) will detect TNOs as small as 10 km. Adapted from 
Jones et al.~(2007).} 
\label{Fig:Af9}
\end{figure}



The following are some examples of the LSST science opportunities in
Solar System science: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Studies of the distribution of orbital elements for over 5 million main-belt 
asteroids as a function of color-based taxonomy (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:asteroids})
and size; size distributions of asteroid families (Parker et al.~2008) and their
correlations with age (Jedicke et al.~2004; Nesvorn\'{y} et al.~2005); dynamical 
effects (Bottke et al.~2001); and studies of object shapes and spin states using 
light curve inversion techniques (Pravec \& Harris 2000; Durech et al.~2009). 
\item Studies of transient activity in asteroids (active asteroids or main belt comets, 
Hsieh \& Jewitt 2006),  due to mass loss with associated extended
morphology.  Only a few such objects are currently known (Jewitt et
al.~2011; Jewitt 2012); LSST
will increase the sample of such objects to $\sim$100. 
\item Studies of the distribution of orbital elements for about 100,000 NEOs as a 
function of color and size (Rabinowitz 1993; Dandy, Fitzsimmons \& Collander-Brown 2002);
correlations with the analogous distributions for 
main-belt objects, and studies of object shapes and structure using light curves. 
\item Studies of the distribution of orbital elements for close to 300,000 Jovian Trojan 
asteroids as a function of color and size (Jewitt, Trujillo \& Luu 2000; Yoshida \& 
Nakamura 2005; Szabo et al.~2007); the search for dynamical families (Kne\v{z}evi\'{c} 
\& Milani 2005); studies of shapes and structure using light curves. 
\item Studies of the distribution of orbital elements for about 30,000 TNOs (see 
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Af9}) as a function of color and size; the search for dynamical families
(Marcus et al.~2011); studies of shapes and structure using light curves (Duncan \& Levison 1995;
Trujillo, Jewitt \& Luu 2001; Gladman et al.~2001; Bernstein et al.~2004; 
Elliot et al.~2005; Jones et al.~2006; Doressoundiram et al.~2007).
\item An unbiased and complete census of both Jupiter-family and Oort-cloud
comets; six-band sub-arcsecond spatial profiles to a faint surface brightness
limit; temporally resolved activity (Lowry et al.~1999; A'Hearn 2004). 
\item Searching for objects with perihelia out to several hundred AU. For example, an object 
like Sedna (Brown, Trujillo \& Rabinowitz 2004) would be detectable at 130 AU. This will result 
in a much larger, well-understood sample of inner Oort Cloud objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113
 (Trujillo \& Sheppard 2014).  Studying the distribution of their orbits (in particular including any 
clustering in the argument of perihelion) will constrain models of the birth environment of the 
Solar System and any potential nearby stellar passages (Kaib \& Quinn 2008; Levison et al.~2010;
Brasser et al.~2012). 
\item Mapping the propagation of interplanetary coronal mass ejections using induced 
 activity in a large sample of comets at different heliocentric distances
(SciBook Ch.~5).

  Novae (MMRD) is as described in Della Valle \& Livio 1995.  LSST
  will open up large regions of this phase space for systematic
  exploration by extending time-volume space over 100 times over
  existing surveys.}
\label{Fig:shri}
\end{figure}

Time domain science will greatly benefit from LSST's unique capability
to simultaneously provide large area coverage, dense temporal
coverage, accurate color information, good image quality, and rapid
data reduction and classification. Since LSST extends time-volume
space more than one hundred times over current surveys (e.g., Morokuma
et al.~2008) it will facilitate new population and statistical studies and
and also the discovery of new classes of
objects.  There are many projects that LSST data products will enable:

\begin{itemize}


\item Discovery and characterization of thousands of hot Jupiters 
  in exoplanetary systems via the transit method (Wright et al.~2012). 
LSST will extend the extrasolar planet census to larger distances within the Galaxy, thus enabling detailed studies 
of planet frequency as a function of stellar metallicity and parent population (e.g., Hartman et al.~2009; Bayliss \& 
Sackett 2011). The out-of-transit variability of exoplanet host stars will also provide characterization of the system 
via flaring behavior and stellar age via gyrochronology, the latter helping constrain theories of tidal evolution and 
migration in giant planets. 

\item Gravitational microlensing in the Milky Way (see Han 2008) as well as in the Local Group and beyond (de Jong, Kuijken \& H\'{e}raudeau 2008).

\item Studies of dwarf novae, including their use as probes of stellar populations and 
      structure in the Local Group (Neill \& Shara 2005; Shara 2006; Shen \& Bildsten 2009). Population studies of the end points of binary evolution differentiating long orbital period vs short orbital period dwarf novae at different places in the galaxy, as well as the numbers of recurrent vs normal novae. Regular cadence, long term color observation on a large sample of galactic sources will enable the identification of CVs containing highly magnetic white dwarfs, that are red due to cyclotron emission from the magnetic accretion column and in low state for the majority of the 10-year survey. 

\item Studies of  transients from poorly-constrained stages of stellar evolution including  
stellar eruptions,  luminous blue variable (LBV), stellar mergers, and helium core flashes leading to white dwarf formation,  both through pre-eruption characterization of sources at the positions of eruptive transients in the ​deep LSST ​stacks​ and detection of faint precursor eruptions, and by constraining rates of individual ​eruption ​subclasses​ (Smith 2014)​​ anddetecting them in galaxies out to tens of Mpc.

\item A census of light echoes of historical explosive and eruptive
  transients in the Milky Way and Local Group through high resolution
  time series​.

\item Studies of known and unusual SN populations and parameterization of their light curves (e.g., Hoeflich, Wheeler \& Thielemann~1998; Wang et al.~2003; Howell et al.~2007; Kowalski et al.~2008; Hicken et al.~2009; Foley~2012​, Bianco et al.~2014, Arcavi~2017​), including late-time observations of rapidly-evolving transients to deep limits, critical for ascertaining their nature. Measurements of intrinsic rates for both peculiar transients (e.g. Drout et al. 2014) and for SN as a function of sub-type and host environment properties (e.g. metallicity; Graur et al. 2017). 

\item A deep search for new populations of novae and supernova progenitors 
      (Smartt 2009; Thompson et al.~2009; Smith et al.~2011; see Fig.\ref{Fig:shri}) both through direct imaging and through the detection of SN precursor events (Ofek et al.~2013), characterization of pre-SN variability of SN progenitors and the frequency of pre-SN outbursts.

\item The discovery of multiply imaged lensed SNe; $\sim500$ multiply
  image SN~Ia are expected to be discovered by LSST (Goldstein \&
  Nugent, 2016)

\item A large, well characterized sample of super luminous supernovae
including object at redshift as high as 2.5, a sample large enough to be leveraged for cosmology  improving constraints on $w$ and $\Omega_m$ (Scovacricchi et al., ~2015).

\item Studies of optical bursters (those varying faster than 1 mag hr$^{-1}$) to $r\sim25$ mag. 

\item Detection and measurement of gamma-ray burst afterglows and transients 
      (e.g., Zhang \& M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros 2004; Zhang et al.~2006; Kann et al.~2010) to high redshift ($\sim$7.5).
 
\item A search for stellar tidal disruptions by nuclear supermassive
  black holes (Evans \& Kochanek 1989; Gezari et al.~2008; Strubbe \&
  Quataert 2009; Bloom et al.~2011; Gezari 2012), as well as binary
  supermassive black holes in the in-spiral phase (e.g., Cuadra et
  al.~2009). Persistent observations will provide complete (except for
  seasonal gaps) lightcurve of long duration events like
  TDEs. Measurements of rates as function of galaxy type, redshift,
  and level of nuclear activity to understand the apparent diversity
  of these events in terms of total power, effective temperature, and
  jet launching efficiency.



\item A study of quasar variability using accurate, multicolor light
  curves for a few million  
quasars, leading to constraints on the accretion physics and nuclear environments (de Vries, Becker 
\& White 2003; Vanden Berk et al.~2004, MacLeod et al.~2010). Relations between quasar variability 
      properties and luminosity, redshift, 
      rest-frame wavelength, time scale, color, radio-jet emission, black-hole 
      mass, and Eddington-normalized luminosity will be defined with massive
      statistics, including the potential to detect rare but important events such as 
      jet flares and obscuration events. Microlensing events will also be monitored in the $\sim$4000 gravitationally-lensed 
      quasars discovered by LSST and used to measure the spatial structure of quasar accretion disks.

\item The superb continuum light curves of AGN will enable economical ``piggyback" 
      reverberation-mapping efforts using spectroscopy of emission lines (Doron \& Eliran 2012). These results 
      will greatly broaden the luminosity-redshift plane of reverberation-mapped AGNs
      with black-hole mass estimates. For LSST data alone, the inter-band continuum lags 
      will provide useful structural information. 

\item Optical identification for transients and variables detected in
  other electromagnetic wavebands, from gamma rays to radio. Examples
  include optical and gamma ray variability in blazars (Hovatta et
  al.~2014), radio transients associated with tidal disruption flares
  (Giannios \& Metzger 2011), and radio counterparts to supernovae and
  GRBs (Gal-Yam et al.~2006). Deep optical observations with LSST may
  also help illuminate the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs, Lorimer et al.~2007; Thornton et al.~2013).

\item Optical identification of counterparts to non-electromagnetic
  sources, such as gravitational waves (GW) and neutrino events
  (LIGO\footnote{http://www.ligo.caltech.edu},
  ICECUBE\footnote{http://icecube.wisc.edu}).  LSST’s unique ability
  to characterize the faint variable sky over large areas will be
  important for the detection of associated sources, with an estimate
  of $\sim 7$ discoveries per year (Scolnic et al. 2017).  The power
  of the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)/Virgo experiment led to the discovery
  of four GW events in less than a year. The binary
  neutron star merger event GW170817 was accompanied by emission
  detected across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (Abbott et
  al.~2017). Multiple teams discovered bright UV/optical/NIR emission
  arising from the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized
  during the NS merger, called kilonova emission (SSS17a).  The
  evolution of the kilonova was somewhat unexpected.  (Abbott et
  al.~2017).  The ~100 kilonovae sample that LSST is expected to
  generate will enable comparative studies of these transients. LSST
  will also be important for eliminating potential false positives
  (Nissanke, Kasliwal \& Georgieva 2013; Metzger \& Berger 2012).

\subsection{Mapping the Milky Way }

The LSST will map the Galaxy in unprecedented detail, and by doing so revolutionize the fields of Galactic 
Astronomy and Near-field Cosmology. The great detail with which the Milky Way can be studied complements 
the statistical power of extra-galactic observations.  The overarching goal of near-field cosmology is to use 
spatial, kinematic, and chemical data sets of stars to reveal the structure and evolution history of the Milky Way
and its environment. LSST will reveal this fossil record in great detail and provide a Rosetta Stone for extragalactic 
astronomy by setting the context within which we interpret these
broader data sets. Moreover, different candidate supersymmetric
particle dark matter models predict different mass clustering on small
scales, and thus different mass functions for subhalos of the Milky
Way.  Thus the LSST census of faint satellites and stellar streams in
the halo will offer a unique means to constrain the 
particle nature of dark matter.

contains information that can be used for source classification and determination of 
detailed stellar properties such as effective temperature and metallicity. LSST will 
enable such measurements for billions of stars.} 
\label{Fig:FeH}
\end{figure}


The LSST will produce a massive and exquisitely accurate photometric and astrometric data set for about 20 billion 
Milky Way stars. The coverage of the Galactic plane will yield data for numerous star-forming 
regions, and the $y$ band data will penetrate through the interstellar dust layer. Photometric metallicity 
measurements (see Figs.~\ref{Fig:FeH} and \ref{Fig:FeH3}) will be available for about 200 million main-sequence 
F/G stars which will sample the halo to distances of 100 kpc (Ivezi\'{c} et al.~2008a; An et al.~2013). No other 
existing or planned survey will provide such a powerful dataset to
study the outer halo: Gaia
is flux limited at $r=20$, and the Dark Energy Survey (Rossetto et al.~2011) and Pan-STARRS both 
lack observations in the $u$ band, necessary for estimating metallicity. The LSST in its standard surveying mode will 
be able to detect RR Lyrae variables (pulsating stars and standard candles) and classical novae (exploding stars 
and standard candles) at a distance of 400 kpc and hence explore the extent and structure of our  halo out to 
half the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. Thus, the LSST will enable studies of the distribution of main-sequence 
stars beyond the presumed edge of the Galaxy's halo (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:halo}), of their metallicity distribution
throughout most of the halo, and of their kinematics beyond the thick disk/halo boundary. LSST will also obtain 
direct distance measurements via trigonometric parallax below the hydrogen-burning limit for a representative
thin-disk sample.

% the SkyMapper (Keller et al.~2001) which is flux limited to $r=22.6$
% (but will nicely complement SDSS in the Southern hemisphere),

In addition to the study of hydrogen burning stars, LSST will uncover the largest sample of stellar remnants to date. 
Over 97\% of all stars eventually exhaust their fuel and cool to become white dwarfs. Given the age of the Galactic 
halo, a significant fraction of the mass in this component may reside in these remnant stars (e.g., Alcock et al.
2000; Tisserand et al.~2007) and therefore their discovery directly constrains the Galactic mass budget.  These large 
populations of disk and halo white dwarfs will provide unprecedented constraints on the luminosity function of
these stars, which will directly yield independent ages for the Galactic disk and halo (e.g., through the initial-final mass
relation, Kalirai et al.~2008).

The sky coverage of LSST naturally targets both field stars and star clusters.  To date, no systematic survey of the stellar 
populations of Southern hemisphere clusters has been performed (e.g., such as the CFHT Open Star Cluster Survey, or 
the WIYN Open Star Cluster Survey in the North; Kalirai et al.~2001; Mathieu 2000).  Multiband imaging of these co-eval, 
co-spatial, and iso-metallic systems will provide vital insights into fundamental stellar evolution.  For example, the depth 
of LSST will enable construction of  luminosity and mass functions for nearby open clusters down to the hydrogen burning
limit and beyond.  Variations in the initial mass function will be studied as a function of environment (e.g., age and metallicity).  
The wide-field coverage will also allow us to track how the stellar populations in each cluster vary as a function of radius, 
from the core to beyond the tidal radius. Fainter remnant white dwarfs will be uncovered in both open and globular clusters
(the nearest of which are all in the South), thereby providing a crucial link to the properties of the now evolved stars in each 
system.

more volume than shown here, enabling a high-fidelity spatial map over the entire observed virial volume.  
Overlaid on this prediction is the observed SDSS stellar number density map based on main sequence stars 
with $0.10 < r-i < 0.15$ (Juri\'{c} et al.~2008).  This map extends up to $\sim$ 20 kpc from the Sun, with 
the white box showing a scale of 20 kpc across and the left side aligned with the Galactic center.  
The revolutionary Galaxy map provided by SDSS is only complete to $\sim$40 kpc, or only $\sim$1\% of
the virial volume.  However, the outermost reaches of the stellar halo are predicted to bear the most unique 
signatures of our Galaxy's formation (Johnston et al.~2008;  Cooper et al.~2010).   LSST will be the only survey 
capable of fully testing such predictions.}
\label{Fig:halo}
\end{figure}

 

In summary, the LSST data will revolutionize studies of the Milky Way and the entire Local Group. We list a few specific 
Galactic science programs that LSST will enable:

\begin{itemize}
\item High-resolution studies of the distribution of stars in the outer halo
          in the six-dimensional space spanned by position, metallicity and proper
          motions (e.g., Girard et al.~2006; Bell et al.~2008; Juri\'{c} et al.~2008;
          Ivezi\'{c} et al.~2008a; Bond et al.~2010).
\item The most complete search possible for halo streams, Galaxy satellites and intra-Local Group 
          stars (e.g., Belokurov et al.~2007a; Walsh, Willman, \& Jerjen 2009; Bochanski et al.~2014).
\item Deep and highly accurate color-magnitude diagrams for over half of the known
          globular clusters, including tangential velocities from proper motion
          measurements (An et al.~2008; Casetti-Dinescu et al.~2007).
\item Mapping the metallicity, kinematics and spatial profile of the Sgr dwarf tidal
          stream (e.g., Ibata et al.~2001; Majewski et al.~2003; Law, Johnston \& Majewski 2005; Belokurov et al.~2014) 
          and the Magellanic stream (Zaritsky et al.~2004).
\item The measurement of the internal motions of Milky Way dwarf 
          galaxies, thereby constraining their density profiles and
	  possibly the nature of dark matter (e.g., Walker \&
	  Pe{\~n}arrubia 2011). 
\item Detailed constraints on the formation and evolution of the populations within the Galactic Bulge, as traced by the spatial 
          distribution, motion, and chemistry of $\sim$10$^{7-8}$ of its stars (e.g., Hill et al.~2011; Ness et al.~2014).
\item Studies of the clumpiness of the gravitational potential in the Galaxy using
          fragile wide-angle binaries selected with the aid of trigonometric and
          photometric parallaxes, and common proper motion (e.g., Yoo, Chanam\'{e} \& Gould 2004; Longhitano \& Binggeli 2010).
\item Detailed studies of variable star populations; 2\% or better accurate
          multicolor light curves will be available for a sample of at least 50
          million variable stars (Sesar et al.~2007), enabling studies of
          cataclysmic variables, eclipsing binary systems, and rare types of variables.
\item Discovery of rare and faint high proper motion objects: probing the
          faint end of the stellar mass function (Lepine 2008; Finch et al.~2010), and searching for
          free-floating planet candidates (Lucas \& Roche 2000; Luhman 2014).
\item Direct measurement of the faint end of the stellar luminosity function
          using trigonometric parallaxes (Reid et al.~2002) and a complete census of the
          solar neighborhood to a distance of 100 pc based on trigonometric parallax measurements for objects as faint as 
          $M_r=17$ ($\sim$L5 brown dwarfs). For example, LSST will deliver 10\% or better distances for a sample of about 2,500 stars
          with 18$<M_r<$19. % Comment: (note there are about 400 brown dwarfs with good parallaxes and Gaia will see about 1000, 
                                          % but most of these will be early L).
\item The separation of halo M sub-dwarfs from disk M dwarfs, using the $z-y$ color which is sensitive to their rich molecular band 
          structure (West et al.~2011; Bochanski et al.~2013).
\item Studies of white dwarfs using samples of several million objects, including the determination of the halo white dwarf luminosity 
          function (SciBook Ch.~6). 
\item Measurements of physical properties of stars using large samples of eclipsing binary stars (Stassun et al.~2013). 
\item High-resolution three-dimensional studies of interstellar dust using 5-color
          SEDs of main sequence stars (Planck Collaboration 2011; Berry et al.~2012; Green et al.~2014).
%\item Planetary transits: the data set may include a mini survey of 600
%         deg$^2$ of sky which will collect about 40 hour-long sequences of 200
%          observations each over a 4-month period (see \S~\ref{Sec:minisurveys}).
%          There would be an additional 800 observations over 10 years of these
%          same fields as part of the main survey. With about 10 million or more stars
%          in the sample (depending on where the fields are placed), this would
%          provide excellent base material to study the planet frequency as a
%          function of stellar type, metallicity, and distance from the Galactic plane
%          (e.g., Charbonneau et al.~2000; Konacki et al.~2003).
\item A census of AGB stars in the Galaxy by searching for resolved envelopes and optical  identifications of IR counterparts
         (e.g., from the WISE survey), and by using long-term variability and color selection (Ivezi\'{c} 2007c).
\item A complete census of faint populations in nearby star forming regions using
          color and variability selection (e.g., Briceno et al.~2005).

\subsection{  Additional Science Projects}

The experience with any large survey (e.g., SDSS, 2MASS, GALEX, to name but a 
few) is that much of their most interesting science is often unrelated to 
the main science drivers, and is often unanticipated at the time the survey is 
designed. LSST will enable far more diverse science than encompassed by the 
four themes that drive the system design. We list a few anticipated major 
programs.

\begin{itemize}
\item Detailed studies of galaxy formation and evolution using their distribution in 
luminosity-color-morphology space as a function of redshift. For example, LSST will 
enable studies of the rest-frame UV emission, similar to those based on GALEX data 
for local galaxies, to a redshift of $\sim$2 for an unprecedentedly large number of
galaxies. These studies project onto many axes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function with redshift, as a function of 
        morphology and color;
  \item the evolution of the galaxy color distribution over a wide range of rest-frame 
        wavelengths, and as a function of luminosity and morphology; 
  \item bulge-disk decomposition, as a function of luminosity and color, over 
        a large redshift range; 
  \item detailed distribution of satellite galaxies in luminosity-color-morphology space 
        as a function of luminosity, color, and morphology of the primary galaxy; 
  \item correlations of luminosity, color and morphology with local environment, and
        as a function of redshift (see  Figs.~\ref{Fig:musyc} and \ref{Fig:cowan});
  \item the properties of galaxy groups as a function of cosmic time.
\end{itemize}
\item AGN census to very faint luminosity and large redshift limit
  (Ivezi\'{c} et al.~2013), yielding 10-40 million objects (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:panels3}). By reaching substantially further 
      down the AGN luminosity function over a very large solid angle, LSST data 
      will test evolutionary cosmic downsizing scenarios, and lead 
      to a much clearer understanding of black-hole growth during the first Gyr. For
      example, LSST should discover $\sim$1000 AGNs at $z\sim6-7.5$,
      representing a dramatic increase over present samples 
      (Brandt et al.~2007; see also SciBook Ch.~10).
\item LSST data will allow good constraints on AGN lifetimes, or at least the timescales over which 
         they make distinct accretion-state transitions, due to large sample
         size and survey lifetime (e.g., Martini \& Schneider 2003).
\item The first wide field survey of ultra low surface brightness galaxies, with 
      photometric redshift information. The currently available samples are highly
      incomplete, especially in the Southern Hemisphere (see Fig.~7 in Belokurov et al.~2007a). 
\item Search for strong gravitational lenses to a faint surface
  brightness limit (e.g., Bartelmann et al.~1998; Tyson, Kochanski \&
  Dell'Antonio 1998; Belokurov et al.~2007b), which can be used to
  explore the dark matter profiles of galaxies (e.g., Treu et
  al.~2006).
\end{itemize}

using the ten nearest neighbors) for galaxies
with the corresponding luminosity and color. Such multi-variate distributions
encode rich information about formation and evolution of galaxies. Galaxies 
detected by SDSS are representative of the low-redshift Universe (the median 
redshift is $\sim$0.1). The LSST will enable such studies as a function of 
redshift, to $z\sim$2. Adapted from Cowan \& Ivezi\'{c}

variability, should be well over 10 million objects.

\subsubsection{  Synergy with other projects }

LSST will not operate in isolation and will greatly benefit from other precursor and coeval 
data at a variety of wavelengths, depths, and timescales. For example,
in the optical, most of the Celestial 
Sphere will be covered to a limit several magnitudes fainter than LSST saturation 
($r\sim16$), first by the combination of SDSS, PS1, the Dark Energy Survey (Flaugher 2006) and SkyMapper (Keller et al.~2007), 
and then by the Gaia survey. The SkyMapper survey will obtain imaging data in the southern
sky to similar depths as SDSS, the PS1 surveys provided multi-epoch data deeper 
than SDSS in the northern sky, and the Dark Energy Survey will scan 
$\sim$5000 deg$^2$ to similar depth as Pan-STARRS in the southern sky. Despite the lack of 
the $u$ band data and a depth about a magnitude shallower, the Pan-STARRS surveys
will represent a valuable complement to LSST in providing North sky coverage to a limit 
fainter than that of SDSS and SkyMapper. LSST and Gaia will 
be highly complementary datasets for studying the Milky Way in the multi-dimensional space of 
three-dimensional positions, proper motions and metallicity (Ivezi\'{c}, Beers \& Juri\'{c} 2012). 
The Gaia survey will provide calibration checks at the bright end for proper 
motions and trigonometric parallax measurements by LSST, and LSST will extend the 
Gaia survey by four magnitudes. The LSST data stream will invigorate subsequent 
investigations by numerous other telescopes that will provide 
additional temporal, spectral and spatial resolution coverage. 

WFIRST and Euclid will carry out wide-field imaging surveys in the
near-infrared, giving highly complementary photometry to LSST.  The
resulting galaxy SEDs should give rise to even better photometric
redshifts, as well as tighter constraints on stellar masses and star
formation histories crucial for galaxy evolution studies.  The weak
lensing analyses from space and from the ground will also be highly
complementary, and will provide crucial cross-checks of one another. 
LSST also presents the opportunity to conduct simultaneous observations 
of WFIRST's Galactic Bulge survey fields, from which it will be possible to 
measure the parallax and hence the lens masses for most microlensing 
events, as well as providing valuable lightcurve coverage during the large 
data gaps between WFIRST survey `seasons'.

LSST will also enable multi-wavelength studies of faint optical
sources using gamma-ray, X-ray, IR and radio data.  For example, the
SDSS detected only 1/3 of all 20cm FIRST sources (Becker et al.~1995)
because it was too shallow by $\sim$4 mag for a complete optical
identification. Similarly, deep optical data are required for
identification of X-ray sources (Brandt \& Hasinger 2005).

LSST will provide a crucial complementary capability to space 
experiments operating in other wavebands, such as the ongoing
%Black Hole Finder Einstein Probe 
NuSTAR Mission (Harrison et al.~2013)
%\footnote{http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/}, 
and the {\it Fermi} 
Gamma-ray Space Telescope (e.g., Atwood et al.~2010). 
%The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the 
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational 
Wave Observatory (LIGO) may detect ultracompact binaries and black hole mergers through the 
gravitational wave outburst that should be emitted during the final stages of such events. 
LSST has the potential to measure the electromagnetic signal that accompanies the gravitational wave emission, 
thereby providing an accurate position on the sky for the system, which is 
crucial for subsequent observations. LSST will also add new value to the archives for 
billion-dollar class space missions such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, Spitzer, Herschel,
etc., because deep optical multi-color data will enable 
massive photometric  studies of sources from these missions;
any areas of the sky -- whether by design or by serendipity -- in which past, present, or future 
multiwavelength surveys overlap with LSST sky coverage, will be further promoted by LSST 
investigations to ``optical plus multiwavelength Selected Areas''.   
Last but not least, the huge samples of various astronomical source
populations will yield extremely rare objects for investigations by powerful
facilities such as JWST (Gardner et al.~2006) and the next generation
of 20-40 meter telescopes.  
%GSMT (Kan \& Antebi 2003).

In summary, the diversity of science enabled by LSST will be 
unparalleled, extending from the physics of gravity and the
early Universe to the properties of ``killer'' asteroids. While
there are other projects that aim to address some of the same
science goals, no other project matches this diversity and 
LSST's potential impact on society in general.
